Okay 👍 if you don’t have SQL Server installed yet, let’s go step by step to install it cleanly.

---

## 🔹 Step 1: Download SQL Server

Go to Microsoft’s official download page:
👉 [Download SQL Server 2022 Developer Edition](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)

* Choose **Developer Edition** (free, full features).
* Run the installer.

---

## 🔹 Step 2: Run the Installer

When the installer opens, you’ll see 3 options:

1. **Basic** → Quick install with defaults.
2. **Custom** → Lets you choose features (good if you want control).
3. **Download Media** → Just downloads setup files.

👉 For simplicity, pick **Basic**.

* Accept license terms.
* It will install to default instance name: `MSSQLSERVER`.

## 🔹 Step 3: Install SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

SQL Server itself is just the **engine**, you also need a tool to interact with it.

Download SSMS here:
👉 [Download SSMS](https://aka.ms/ssmsfullsetup)

* Install it (default options are fine).
* Open SSMS after installation.

---

## 🔹 Step 4: Connect to Your Server

When SSMS opens:

* **Server type:** Database Engine
* **Server name:** `localhost` (or `.` or `(local)`)
* **Authentication:** Windows Authentication
* Click **Connect**

If it connects successfully → SQL Server is ready 🎉.

## 🔹 Step 5: Use in .NET

In your `appsettings.json` of your WebApi project, connection string will look like:

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Database=MyAppDb;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;"
}
```

👉 Do you want me to show you how to also create a **test database and table** immediately after setup so you can confirm it’s working?
